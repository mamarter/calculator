Calculator

Description:
The Calculator class processes mathematical expressions formed by operators and operands called symbols in this project.
The currently accepted symbols are addition, substraction, multiplication, division, parenthesis and decimal numbers.
To evaluate a string of operations it first converts the expression from infix notation to reverse polish
notation (RPN) relying on order of operations (based on the Shunting-yard algorithm). Then resolves the equation
storing intermediate results in a stack.


The main class Calculator uses a class to store each token. This class is called Symbol and represents each element 
found in a mathematical expression. A symbol can be either a number (that will be an operand) or an operator of the 
Calculator class. It stores a string as a member variable.
class Number is a subclass of Symbol and represents numbers. It stores a decimal value.
class Operator is a subclass of Symbol and represents an operator. It stores the type of operation 
that performs.
